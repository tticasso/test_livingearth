## {{ page.title }}
Carbon credits (or allowances) are typically brought from a government with this giving an organisaton (e.g., a company) to generate one ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.  When in excess, these can be brought by other companies.  When an organisation removes a unit of carbon from the atmosphere, they generate a carbon offset (or offset credit) which other organisations can then buy.  The number of credits issues each year is determined primarily by emissions targets. Carbon offset projects include afforestation, reforestation and changes in land use, improvements in energy efficiency and renewable energy.
