## {{ page.title }}
To value biodiversity, each of the different ecosystem processses need to be considered in terms of their contribution to ecosystem services.  As an example, forests intercept water and filters nutrients which then reduces flooding and pollution downstream and birds, mammals and insects pollinate many plant species that are of value also to humans.
