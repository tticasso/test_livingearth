subheading="Wales has a rich biodiversity with many icon species. However, the abundance and distribution of fauna and flora has reduced overall over past decades but this is often piecemeal and therefore not evident in many cases. The environmental descriptors and land cover maps generated by Living Wales provide a valuable and expanding resource by which to understand where our biodiversity is located and how to reverse declines but also highlight successes so that we can build on these."
