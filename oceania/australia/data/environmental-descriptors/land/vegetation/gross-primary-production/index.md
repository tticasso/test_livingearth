## Gross Primary Production

![Gross Primary Production](/assets/img/australia/big/default.jpg)

##### Gross Primary Production (GPP) is defined as the amount of carbon uptake by plants per time unit through the photosynthesis process.

GPP is an important variable as it partially supports plant respiration.

GPP cannot be directly measured but can be estimated through meteorological towers (CO2 exchanges) (see here) or using satellite sensors.

Unit: _gC/m2/day_
