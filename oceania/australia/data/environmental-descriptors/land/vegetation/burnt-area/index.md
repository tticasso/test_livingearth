##### Burnt area products map the areas affected by fires and give temporal information on the fire events.

Whereas fires are part of natural processes, they can also lead to environment disturbances. Indeed, fires are a major factor in land covers change as they affect the whole environment, including soil, water, air, wildlife, etc. For example, fires allow the renew of the vegetation but contribute as well to the increase in Carbon dioxide, Methane, Aerosols, Carbon monoxide (etc.), thus affecting the local and regional air quality.

Burnt areas can be observed from ground level as well as from space.
