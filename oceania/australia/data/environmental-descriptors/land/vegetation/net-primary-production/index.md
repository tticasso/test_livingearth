## Net Primary Production

![](/assets/img/australia/big/default.jpg)

##### Net Primary Production (NPP) is defined as the net amount of carbon uptake after subtracting plant respiration (plant CO2 release) from Gross Primary Product (plant CO2 uptake).

NPP measures the mass of the new plant growth (fixed carbon) during a time period.

NPP can be estimated by ground measurements (see here) or through satellite/airborne sensors.

Unit: _gC/m2/day_
