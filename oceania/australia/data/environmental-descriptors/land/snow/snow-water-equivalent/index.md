## Snow Water Equivalent

![Snow Water Equivalent](/assets/img/wales/big/snow-water-equivalent.jpg)

##### Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) is the amount of water contained within the snowpack.

In other terms, it is the depth of water that would theoretically result from instantaneous snowpack melting.

SWE is correlated with snowpack depth and snow density. It is an important variable for different applications such as water stocks monitoring and flood events forecasting.

Snow Water Equivalent can be manually measured or estimated through non-contact devices from ground-level or space.

Unit: _mm_
