## Snow Cover Fraction

![Snow Cover Fraction](/assets/img/wales/big/snow-cover-fraction.jpg)

##### Snow Cover Fraction (SCF) is defined as the fraction of land area covered by snow.

Snow has a very high albedo, which participates to cool the Earth surface. As a consequence, snow cover is an important variable as it directly affects the Earthâ€™s energy balance. It is of major concern for various fields such as weather forecasting, climate change, water management, etc.

SCF can be estimated from ground level, as well as, from spatial sensors.

Unit: _Fraction or percentage_
