                <h3>The world is changing rapidly and there is an urgent need to monitor our landscapes and proactively plan for the future, particularly given the current emergencies in climate and biodiversity and the need for sustainable use of our land and resources.</h3>
                <p class="mt-3">Living Wales is a unique and novel world-first concept that is using satellite data to capture detailed spatial information on the state and dynamics of Wales’s landscape, in near real time and historically (since 1985), to inform future land management and policy. The project, which has been funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) Ser Cyrmu II program and Welsh Government, has been working with a wide range of organisations across the country, the wider UK and internationally to establish a method for land monitoring that can be applied consistently across Wales but also other countries and regions.</p>
                <p>The approach uses that satellite data to mirror how people observe and describe landscapes on the ground and how these are changing. For this, use is made of a globally relevant and scalable land cover classification taxonomy that first asks for broad descriptions of landscapes, such as whether they are comprised primarily of natural or cultivated vegetation, buildings, bare surfaces or water. Further categorical or numerical descriptions are then used in a logical and progressive sequence to construct more detailed classifications. For monitoring change, this collated information is compared over time to gather evidence for both natural and human-induced pressures and impacts according to a pre-defined globally relevant taxonomy.</p>
                <p>Using this approach, annual maps of land cover and contributing information have been generated for Wales and released through a publicly-accessible geoportal (wales.livingearth.online). These maps are providing an open and expanding resource for people in Wales to be informed of the past and present changes that have shaped the national landscape and new capacity to envisage future landscapes under different change scenarios.</p>
                <p>To allow public viewing of the land cover maps for Wales as well as other satellite-derived products that explore the environmental impacts of land use and climate change, Living Wales has established an exhibition and training facility at the Centre for Alternative Technology near Machynlleth. A parallel exhibition is also being developed within the new refurbishment of Aberystwyth University’s Old College.</p>
                <p>Within this exhibition are displays that feature outputs from a range of remote sensing projects undertaken at Aberystwyth University. These include land cover maps for multiple years for Australia, which were and continue to be generated in parallel with Living Wales, detailed images from around the world acquired by PlanetLab’s high resolution satellite sensor data, and global maps of mangrove extent and change generated through our Global Mangrove Watch. The European Space Agency’s (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) also features highly with up-to-date information on climate change conveyed. The ESA display includes three global maps of the tonnage of biomass held within the World’s forests that have been generated recently through the CCI Biomass project, which is managed and coordinated by Aberystwyth University. These maps are being used to validate the outputs and support the development of global climate models to better determine likely future impacts. New insights into the carbon dynamics of vegetation are been displayed in parallel at the Conference of Parties (COP) in Glasgow in November 2021.</p>
                <p>THEN MOVE INTO THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WITH DEMONSTRATION FOR WALES</p>
                <p>WALES</p>
                <p>Living Wales is providing detailed (nominally 10 m) land cover descriptions and classifications across Wales on at least an annual basis, The project is starting to deliver numerous benefits for Wales, including, but not limited to better understanding the allocation of carbon within different landscapes and how this is changing and the distribution of native flora and fauna. As the system is being populated with data from different sensors over extended time-periods, the project is starting to provide “data storytelling”, with this informing policy development, land management decisions and restoration plans.</p>
