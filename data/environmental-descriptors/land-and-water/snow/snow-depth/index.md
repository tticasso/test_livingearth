## Snow Depth

##### Ecosystems are generally complex and difficult to define and, more often than not, comprise a wide range of habitats; typically combining semi-natural, agricultural and non-natural components.

Snow depth is the total depth of the snowpack. It allows to estimate the amount of snow covering the ground.

Snow depth and snow water equivalent are two linked variables. They are both very important variables for different applications such as water stocks monitoring and flood events forecasting.

Snow depth can be manually measured or estimated through non-contact devices from ground-level or space.
