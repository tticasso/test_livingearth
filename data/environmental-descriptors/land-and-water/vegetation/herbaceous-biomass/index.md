## Herbaceous Biomass

![Herbaceous Biomass](/assets/img/wales/big/herbaceous-biomass.jpg)

##### Herbaceous biomass is defined as the total mass of living plants, that have a non-woody stem, per area.

Aboveground biomass plays a key role in the carbon cycle and climate processes and is of major importance in various field such as agronomy, biodiversity, climate, energy production, etc.

Herbaceous biomass can be measured through destructive or indirect methods in the field (see [here](https://livingearth.aber.ac.uk/data/ground-measurements/technics/herbaceous-biomass-ground-measurements/)). However, sensing herbaceous biomass over large areas from satellite/airborne sensors is still quite challenging.
