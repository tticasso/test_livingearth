## Lifeform

##### Vegetation life-form (growth form) classes are defined based on structural similarities of plants.

Three main life-forms are encountered in the nature: woody, herbaceous and lichens/mosses forms.

Identification of life-forms can be performed through human resources (see [here](https://livingearth.aber.ac.uk/data/ground-measurements/technics/lifeform-ground-measurements/)). However, this is a long, expensive and fastidious task. Furthermore, all land surface areas are not necessarily accessible to human people. Plant life-form can be automatically identified by satellite/airborne sensors.
