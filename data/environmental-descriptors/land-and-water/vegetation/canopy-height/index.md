##### Canopy height is the height (in meters) of the top aboveground vegetation.

Canopy height is an important structural variable as it directly influences a large number of processes. This variable is a major concern for agricultural, ecological and meteorological fields and their applications. For instance, canopy height has a direct impact on wind speed which is an important variable for weather forecasting and all the resulting applications.

Canopy height can be measured through field campaigns (see [here](https://livingearth.aber.ac.uk/data/ground-measurements/technics/canopy-height-measurements/)) or remote sensed from LiDAR or radar sensors.
