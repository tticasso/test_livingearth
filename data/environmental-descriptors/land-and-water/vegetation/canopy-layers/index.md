## Canopy Layers

![Canopy Layers](/assets/img/wales/big/canopy-layers.jpg)

##### Vegetated areas are composed of a top canopy layer.

However, they also have a vertical structure and different understory vegetated layers/strata can be encountered.

The understory is composed of a shrub layer, a field layer (ferns, herbaceous and graminoids) and a ground layer (mosses and lichens). However, vertical structure of vegetation differs from an area to another and all the previously mentioned layers do not necessarily exist in all vegetated areas.
