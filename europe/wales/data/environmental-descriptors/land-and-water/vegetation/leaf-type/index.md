## Leaf Type

![Leaf Type](/assets/img/wales/big/leaf-type.jpg)

##### There are many types of leaves.

Leaf type is defined as the type of leaf morphology. It is mainly linked to the botanical group of plants (_Angiosperm_ and _Gymnosperm_).

The two main types of leaves are the broadleaves and the needle-leaves. Broadleaves is the most common type of leaves that can be encountered on flowering plants. Broadleaves are flat and broad. On another hand, needle-leaved plants have leaves shaped like needles that are, most of the time, persistent during winter.

Leaf type can be identified from ground observations (see [here](https://livingearth.aber.ac.uk/data/ground-measurements/technics/leaf-type-ground-measurement/)) but can also be determined through satellite/airborne-derived images.
