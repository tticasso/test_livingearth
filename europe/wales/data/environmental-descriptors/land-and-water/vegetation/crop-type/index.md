## Crop Type

##### The crop type is the type of plants cultivated in the fields during the main growing season.

The crop type can be, for example, maize, potatoes, etc.

The type of crops is important for various applications such as hydrological modelling, plant health, crop science, environment monitoring, biodiversity safeguard, etc. Indeed, the type of plants directly affects biological, biogeochemical and hydrological systems. For instance, it has been shown that the crop type affects the species richness and abundance.

Crop types can be identified during field surveys (see [here](https://livingearth.aber.ac.uk/data/ground-measurements/technics/crop-type-ground-measurements/)) or sensed from satellite or airborne sensors.
