## Woody Biomass

##### Woody biomass is defined as the total mass of living plant material per woody area.

Aboveground biomass plays a key role in the carbon cycle and climate processes. It can be measured through direct or indirect in situ sampling (see here) or estimated through satellite/airborne sensors.

Typically, biomass in woody areas ranges between 0 (poorly vegetated areas) and ~ 600 Mg/ha (Congo rainforest).
