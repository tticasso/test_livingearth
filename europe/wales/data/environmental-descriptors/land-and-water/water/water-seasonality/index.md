##### Water seasonality is the persistence of the water at the surface.

At the surface, the water presence duration depends on several environmental variables such as precipitation rates, soil permeability, geological formations, etc.

Water seasonality is an important variable for all the fields relying on water management, such as agriculture, water suppliers, etc. As an example, water presence duration is a major variable for rice cultivation. As all living beings depends on water, water seasonality is also an important variable when dealing with life and biodiversity.

Water seasonality can be estimated from ground observations but from remote sensors as well.
