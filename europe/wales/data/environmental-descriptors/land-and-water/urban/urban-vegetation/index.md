##### Urban vegetation is defined as the vegetation in cities.

Vegetation is of major importance in urban areas as it provides a large number of ecosystem services, such as pollutants and fine particulates filtering.

Urban vegetation is classified in a separate class, compared to the rest of the vegetation, as it is surrounded by impervious surfaces which impact the water, energy and material fluxes between the vegetation, the soil and the air.

Urban vegetation classification is performed from ground digitalisation or using satellite/airborne sensors.
